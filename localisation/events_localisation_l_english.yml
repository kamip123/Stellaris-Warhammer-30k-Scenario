### lore explanation and starting message
lorexp.99.desc:0 "Hello everyone! I hope you will enjoy playing this mod :) It's not easy to win so don't worry if you lose. I recomend to play in insane difficulty with agressive AI. Current state of the mod is open Beta. I kept making this mod with 1.9 update in mind so few things don't work as I want them to work but we have to wait a little. For best experience I recomend playing on multiplayer. You start in 34M and go trought many avents to the begining of 42M. I made many changes to lore for example the starting date of certain events or necrons presented at the begining of the campaign. All this changes was for gameplay purpose. Losing in certain events can trigger new events or other events faster so be aware. That's it for now. Some events explaining lore a bit will trigger soon.

lorexp.1.desc:0 "The Imperium of Man is a galaxy-spanning interstellar human empire, the ultimate authority for the majority of the human race in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is ruled by the living god who is known as the Emperor of Mankind, the founder of the Imperium and the most powerful human psyker ever born. However, His badly damaged body is interred within the cybernetic life support mechanisms of the arcane device known as the Golden Throne. Because of this terrible fate, the Emperor is incapable of interacting with others The Imperium is the largest and currently most powerful political entity in the galaxy, consisting of at least 1,000,000 human-settled worlds dispersed across most of the Milky Way Galaxy."
lorexp.2.desc:0 "Chaos is the universal and usually malign spiritual force embodied by the malevolent intelligent entities comprised of psychic energy that live in the Warp. Chaos is also itself the turbulent psychic energy that comprises the Immaterium and gives shape to the nightmare domains of the individual Chaos Gods that are collectively called the Realm of Chaos by savants of the Inquisition. The most powerful entities of Chaos are the four great Chaos Gods Tzeentch, Nurgle, Khorne and Slaanesh, also known as the Ruinous Powers, who each embody one aspect of the greater force of Chaos and can be worshipped individually or as an entire pantheon."
lorexp.3.desc:0 "The Orks, also called Greenskins, are a savage, warlike, green-skinned race of humanoids who are spread all across the Milky Way Galaxy. Greenskins are one of the most dangerous alien races to plague the galaxy. Numerous beyond belief and driven always to fight and conquer, the Orks threaten every single intelligent species of the galaxy. The Orks are a biologically-engineered species, created more than 60 million Terran years ago as a warrior race originally called the Krork by the long-vanished reptilian alien species known as the Old Ones."
lorexp.4.desc:0 "The Eldar are an ancient humanoid alien race whose vast empire once extended the width and breadth of the known galaxy. Their empire was without equal, and they counted themselves masters of the stars. But millennia ago, their overweening pride and their fall into hedonistic practices led to a cataclysm that all but eradicated their kind and led to the birth of the Chaos God Slaanesh. Despite their boundless power, the heart of their civilisation was torn out by this catastrophe of their own making, forcing the surviving Eldar to flee upon gigantic, continent-size starships called Craftworlds. Now they cling to survival by a thread, fighting the horrors of the galaxy with ritualised discipline and consummate skill."
lorexp.5.desc:0 "The Dark Eldar are the forsaken and corrupt kindred of the Eldar, an ancient and highly advanced alien race of fey humanoids. Their armies, like their Eldar counterparts, usually have the advantages of mobility and advanced technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers. The Dark Eldar revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. They strike with little or no warning, using an interdimensional labyrinth known as the Webway to traverse the galaxy safely and far more quickly than most advanced races are able to with their Warp jumps. The Dark Eldar are unique amongst the intelligent races of the Milky Way Galaxy because they do not live on a settled world or worlds, but rather the bulk of their population is concentrated in one foul city-state the Dark City of Commorragh that lies within the Immaterium of the Eldar Webway."
lorexp.6.desc:0 "The Tau are a young, humanoid and technologically-advanced intelligent race native to the Eastern Fringes of the Milky Way Galaxy who are fighting to expand their interstellar empire and extend a philosophical concept they call the Greater Good to all the intelligent species of the galaxy. The Tau claim to be a peaceful race when possible, asking if others will join their cause voluntarily instead of fighting against them. However, if their peaceful overtures are refused, the Tau may well decide to conquer a planet and add it to their growing interstellar empire for the Greater Good, searing the flesh from the bones of anyone who stands against their benign intentions. Tau society is divided into a number of castes, each responsible for managing a specific aspect of their society. The Tau's central motivating ideal is that everyone in their empire regardless of their species will work for the collective betterment of everyone else, an almost mystical philosophy they call the Greater Good."
lorexp.7.desc:0 "The Necrons are a mysterious race of robotic skeletal warriors that have lain dormant in their stasis-tombs for more than 60 million Terran years and who are the soulless creations and former servants of the ancient C'tan, the terrible Star Gods of Eldar myth. The Necrons are ancient beyond reckoning, predating even the birth of the Eldar. At long last, however, they are beginning to awaken from their Tomb Worlds, for the galaxy is ripe for conquest and the restoration of the Necron Empire since the disappearance of the Old Ones more than 60 million standard years ago. The Necrons are a completely robotic humanoid species whose technological prowess is probably unmatched by any of the other intelligent species of the galaxy. Yet out of a desire for vengeance against the more fortunate long-lived ancient xenos race called the Old Ones, and the trickery of the godlike intelligences known as the C'tan, the Necrons shed their original organic forms and lost all forms of compassion and empathy, becoming ruthless, undying killing machines who are determined to exert their mastery over the galaxy once more."
lorexp.8.desc:0 "Tarellians, more commonly known in the Imperium of Man as Tarellian Dog-Soldiers because of their snouts and their preference for working as mercenaries for other alien races, are a minor reptilian species of xenos found throughout the galaxy, but are of little consequence to its affairs. The Tarellians possess a zealous hatred for Mankind above all other peoples in the galaxy because of the Imperium's decision to launch Exterminatus attacks upon the Tarellian homeworlds during the Great Crusade in the late 30th Millennium, nearly wiping out their species in a horrific way through the use of Virus Bombs. Billions of their kind were slaughtered in the most horrific manner possible and the Tarellian species never fully recovered from this terrible xenocide. The Imperium's actions, which was a standard response to a meeting with another intelligent alien race during the Great Crusade, destroyed the Tarellian potential to grow into one of the dominant races of the galaxy and created their eternal grudge against all servants of the Emperor of Mankind."
lorexp.9.desc:0 "The Hellgrammite are a mysterious and powerful xenos empire based out of the Laanath Rifts. Their true name is unknown and is only a title given by Imperial soldiers, for they showed no interest in communication with humans and were extremely hostile. Described as foul anthropoid creatures with decayed physical forms, they possessed sinister occult-infused weaponry and rode into battle on the backs of bio-mechanical monsters and abominations capable of ripping through heavy armor with ease."
lorexp.10.desc:0 "The Jorgall are a race of aliens. They traveled between planets in enormous cylindrical spacecraft with chlorinated atmospheres. The Jorgall were radially symmetrical with three arms and legs, scaly and horned skin, and an egg-shaped head with fleshy notches for mouths and noses atop an extensible neck. The nervous system was centralized in the torso and their circulatory systems pumped foul-smelling crimson blood. A mature adult stood 4.5 metres tall. All Jorgalli encountered had extensive cybernetic augmentation including wheels for feet, claws for hands, teleoptic cameras in place of eyes, subdermal armour, or implanted needler weapons."
lorexp.11.desc:0 "The Rak’Gol are a vicious xeno race of Marauder pirates found in the Koronus Expanse. The slightest mention of their name makes the denizens of the expanse highly superstitious as it is said to invite the brutal creatures to attack. Rak’Gol typically possess eight limbs, while not in pursuit a Rak’Gol will walk upright on four limbs using the other four for various functions. While chasing prey the Rak’Gol can easily alter its body position so that it can use all eight limbs for locomotion. A Rak’Gol’s upper four limbs are adaptable and can change their musculature to use as hands with opposable digits or as grasping feet. A Rak’Gol’s limbs are strong enough that an adult can climb and run upside down."
lorexp.12.desc:0 "The Slaugth are a xenos race, vaguely humanoid in shape, covered in hundreds of half-melded maggot-like worms. Covered in viscous mucus, they are impervious to all but the most extreme injury. The Slaugth are believed to be impossibly ancient, likely native to the Calixis Sector long before the arrival of Mankind. Much of their known activity takes place around the region of the Hazeroth Abyss that consists of cursed space and dead stars. Their true homeworld is, however, unknown and may not be located within the Abyss."
lorexp.13.desc:0 "The Age of Apostasy was a second period of interstellar civil war that consumed the Imperium of Man in the early 36th Millennium. The terrible conflicts of the Age of Apostasy grew out of a political struggle between the Administratum and the Adeptus Ministorum for dominance over the Imperium. The period is usually divided into two separate major events by Imperial historians known as the Reign of Blood and the Plague of Unbelief. The struggle began when control over the Imperium's government was essentially seized by a single man, the High Lord of Terra Goge Vandire, who commanded both the Administratum and the Ecclesiarchy and ruled the Imperium according to his own wishes instead of in-accordance with the Emperor's will."
lorexp.14.desc:0 "The Angevin Crusade is a Crusade focused around the Calixis Sector. The Crusade began officially when the High Lords of Terra authorized Lord Militant Golgenna Angevin to liberate the areas around the Calyx Expanse. His forces, drawn from Segmentum Solar, numbered over 17 million troops divided into four battle groups and a strategic reserve plus Space Marines from the Black Templars, Sons of Medusa, Tigers Argent, and Charnel Guard Chapters. Titan Legions from the Legio Venator and Legio Magna also contributed to the Crusade's cause."
lorexp.15.desc:0 "Let me take you through the average Warp travel procedure. The Captain calls down to prep the ship for Warp expedition. At that time 12000 slaves who have never seen the outside of the work galley begin shovelling the dead bodies of previous workers into massive furnaces along with whatever hard fuel source they have in storage, like a brutal Mr Fusion. A field of pure ***** is generated around the ship and the blinded mentally traumatized man inside a metal egg begins screaming unendingly as he charts a course through the Warp, which is basically a giant ocean of pure emotion in which Unnamed Ones lounge around and f*ck with humanity by the luxury of simply existing. The ship then ploughs into the miasma of what you would call Hell if you lacked imagination. Pray to the Holy Throne the Astropath doesn’t accidentally get you lost, become possessed by a Daemon or just explode like a mushy human pinata from the mental stress of being around so much pure CANNOT BE. If the void shields even flicker on the 8000 year old vessel (which no one actually understands completely how to work) Daemons made out of RAPE and LEMON JUICE will crawl into our reality and do things you literally cannot imagine to every soul aboard. I mean that. The very notion of understanding the completeness of the horror the human victims will be witness to would shatter your perception of reality and cause your head to explode. Mission clock says they were only in the Warp for 5 days. It was 17 months for everyone onboard. They also missed their destination by a couple of solar systems and 8/10th of the crew is dead. The Captain turns to his bridge staff and pops the cork on a vintage stock of Jherrik Ale and salutes another successful Warp Jump. Welcome to 40K."
lorexp.20.desc:0 "Current situation: 2 ongoing crusade. One in calixis sector. They face many xenos races as well as independent human states and one of them are tainted with chaos. Right now Battlefleet and Army station in Scintilla System waiting for orders. Second crusade es in Ultima Segmentum near Kar Duniash. This Segmentum fortress was conquered by nearby xenos Empire and Black Tempalrs with support of many other Space Marine Chapters are Preaparing for immediate strike. Adeptus Mechanicus send many skittari regiments as well as Powerful Titans legions to save this vital Forge world. Battlefleet have meet with Eternal Cruseder and crusade army few jumps from Kar Duniash. Led them to victory! Around whole galaxy Necrons start to awake. Be prepared for hard battles since their technology is much more advanced than ours. Chaos is preparing invasion across the whole galaxy so stay vigilant all the time. In estern fringle a new empire grew to power.. the Tau - young race with great potential. Their technology is worse than ours but in short time they will advance beyond us. Imperium shall nor fail and We will rule the galaxy!"

######## Black Crusades ##########################

### 1
bc1.1.desc:0 "Abaddon the Despoiler made many blood pacts with the Dark Gods in the wake of Horus' defeat during the Horus Heresy. Abaddon is making his first attempt to launch a new offensive against the Imperium of Man following the Horus Heresy and is initiating the 1st Black Crusade. His fleet is attacking the Cadia Sector! Following the relative success of this deadly incursion across the Segmentum Obscurus, the Ruinous Powers grant Abaddon the means to further increase his already formidable power. On the world of Uralan, by the will of the Dark Gods, Abaddon recovered the Daemonsword Drach'nyen after battling his way through a haunted labyrinth to the great inner chamber where the blade had languished in stasis for millennia. The howling sword contained the bound essence of a dangerous Warp entity who had the power to rend reality apart wherever the weapon strikes. After the recovery of the malefic sword, Abaddon's power swelled to inhuman proportions and he was recognised as Horus Lupercal's true successor amongst the Traitor Legions, the new Warmaster of Chaos Undivided."

Abaddon leads the charge against the adamantium gates of the famously unbreachable citadel upon the world of El'Phanor. Only one in ten of Abaddon's spearhead reach the gates before they are trapped by Heavy Bolter fire. Utilising his Daemon Sword Drach'nyen, the gates of the citadel prove harder than diamond, but they split apart like cordwood before Abaddon's dolorous blow. In an orgy of violence, the Traitor Legions and their daemonic allies fall upon Kromarch and his kin, extinguishing their ancient line forever."

In a bitter last stand, both Loyalist Chapters are utterly destroyed, their skulls taken by the ancient Daemon Prince Doombreed, whose existence precedes that of the Imperium itself, to be mounted upon the mighty throne of Khorne."

During the campaign of the 6th Black Crusade, Abaddon besieged the Imperial Forge World of Arkreach, offering Drecarth and his Sons of the Eye an equal share of the plunder. For months, the two forces of Chaos Space Marines fought side-by-side against the defences of the Adeptus Mechanicus, bombarding their great forge cities from space. Finally, the Traitors stood triumphant in the smouldering ruins of the great manufactoria, Mechanicus dead littering the ground. As Drecarth extended his hand in greeting, Abaddon grasped it with his own, only to thrust the claws of the Talon of Horus into his fellow Chaos Lord's gut. Drecarth lived long enough to see the Sons of the Eye bow to Abaddon and be reabsorbed into the Black Legion before the Warmaster of Chaos tore out his skull and spine. Thus did Abaddon deliver a dire warning to any who dared challenge his power."

neco1.1.desc:0 "My Lord! We have received word via Astropath that the alarm on the Inquisitorial Fortress of Apollyon has been sounded! We have been unable to reach them, and contact has been similarly lost with the frontier worlds of Pallasite, Khatris, and Borrus, as well as the Mechanicus world of Harrow Watch and…by the Emperor, we have been unable to hail Libethra, Fortress Monastary of the Angels Revenant. After what appears to have been several months, we have received word that Sector Governor Calibron Laan, the paranoid coward, has amassed all available PDF, Astra Militarum, and Imperial Navy forces around the capital of Amarah, allowing other systems to fall virtually undefended. We have also received word that enemy vessels have been detected amassing near Amarah, just outside of the system.  A single phrase is being transmitted over and over, “Maynarkh comes.” It is, to say the least, ominous, and our psykers and astropaths cannot make sense of it, but we have noticed a sense of borderline-heretical dread sweeping over our crew. We must muster our forces and move to Amarah’s defense at once, lest the capital fall and by extension the entire Orpheus Sector!"
neco1.2.desc:0 "Foul Necrons of the Maynarkh Dynasty dare to attack an Imperial planet once more! Their main fleet approaches, with their ground troops not far behind, we must not let them land upon that world. My Lord, we must muster our forces and prepare for war!"
neco1.3.desc:0 "Yet another wave of Necrons of the Maynarkh Dynasty awaken my Lord, their Harvester Fleet grows ever larger. Forgive me, my Lord, but I do not like our odds. Yet by the Emperor’s teeth, we must fight on, lest they conquer even more worlds and bring death to the faithful on the planet below. Let us deliver unto them the wrath of Him on Holy Terra!”
neco1.4.desc:0 "Even more Necrons have arrived, my Lord, more than our chief strategists thought possible! Our fleets are being overwhelmed, and the Minotaurs have taken grievous casualties in destroying a Necron Tomb Ship, with Lord Asterion Moloc himself being wounded in his battle with a Necron Overlord aboard the Death Hand, but nevertheless, we cannot allow the Orpheus sector to fall to these abominable machines! Let us make them regret the day they dared to enter our space, and let us make them rue being created xenos filth!”
neco1.5.desc:0 "A final wave of Necrons have entered the Orpheus sector and are engaging all of our remaining strongholds! Most of the PDFs, the Orphean Guard, the Kriegers’ 17th & 60th Line Korps, the Astartes delegations, and even the Minotaurs of the Adeptus Astartes have taken horrific casualties, my Lord, and it is up to us to ensure that this system does not fall into the detestable claws of the alien! It may be a losing battle, but it shall not be one that the reprehensible xeno will soon forget. Let us show them the teeth, the fury, and the hate of man! For the Imperium! For the Orpheus Sector!

We won!"

arg2.5.desc:0 "The Imperial planetary governor, Overlord Herman von Strab, was completely unprepared for the attack, and his own pride and incompetence only made matters worse. Eventually, the defense of the planet was taken over by Commander Dante of the Blood Angels Space Marines. During the war, an Imperial Commissar named Yarrick, who had been exiled by Von Strab to Hades Hive, led a heroic defense of that hive city that eventually distracted Ghazghkull, infuriating him enough to send more and more Ork forces against Hades Hive. The battle escalated to such proportions that Ghazghkull considered the fight a matter of personal pride, and took command of the forces of Hades himself, blinding him to the other battles on the world. Although the hive city eventually fell, the distraction gave the Imperial forces enough time to mount a counterattack that finally broke the back of the Ork invasion force. We won!"

#3rd War for Armageddon
arg3.1.desc:0 "Fifty-seven standard years to the day after his first attempt to conquer Armageddon, Ghazghkull Thraka led a second Ork WAAAGH! against the planet in 998.M41, unleashing the Third War for Armageddon.

Ghazghkull has left the planet, pursued by Commissar Yarrick's Imperial Guard forces, accompanied by High Marshal Helbrecht with a full Black Templars Crusade at his back. The Orks have come to regard Armageddon as a kind of Valhalla, where they can always come to find a good fight, and the Imperium must still send more troops to battle to keep the planet in Imperial hands. But now when huge warpstorms erupt across the whole galaxy and the one in Armageddon sector is probably the strongest. Millions of deamons are attacking the sector! During the period of the Noctis Aeterna, reinforcements were cut off, and those en route to the system were swept into oblivion. Those combatants who remained on Armageddon were forced to face not just each other, but oncoming waves of daemons. At times, so desperate were the defenders that Ork and humans fought alongside each other against the greater threat. Such temporary ceasefires never lasted long."

arg3.5.desc:0 "By the time the beacon of the Astronomican burned bright once more and easy travel through the Immaterium was possible, an Imperial relief force arrived to find the landscape of Armageddon greatly changed. At the height of the Warp Storms, the daemonic forces of Tzeentch and Khorne had battled each other as part of their eternal competition in the Great Game. The Orks and Imperial defenders sought cover as titanic Greater Daemons duelled for supremacy. Fully half the planet was reshaped into a hellish landscape reminiscent of many Daemon Worlds – a nightmare born of the Warp merged with the ruins of a war-torn Hive World. The Imperial reinforcements, led by elements of nine Space Marine Chapters with the Salamanders in overall command, succeeded in halting a daemonic ritual that would have brought Angron, the Primarch of the World Eaters, back to the world that had defied him during the First War for Armageddon."

######## Tyranids ################################

##### Hive Fleet Behemoth
tyrbeh1.1.desc:0 "Our explorators encounter strange anomaly. In the estern fringe of the galaxy they found that many worlds known to once have been verdant planets teeming with all manner of alien animals and plants had been stripped bare, reduced to barren rocks floating in the vacuum. Not one speck of life, not even the simplest of bacteria, remained to be found."
tyrbeh1.2.desc:0 "Xenos are attacking! We don't know who they are and what they are acapable of but for the Emperor we will not surrender!!! ..... Our lasers had begun to glow white hot and overheat from the sheer number of targets, but the invaders withdrew! ... Wait... It was a trap! There are thousands of them! We need supp.......... Error..... Message Error....."
tyrbeh1.3.desc:0 "We send Inquisitor Kryptman of the Ordo Xenos to investigate the strange planet-stripping phenomenon. Adepts of the Adeptus Mechanicus who accompanied Kryptman managed to gather vital information. Before being overrun, Magos Tech-priest Varnak had gathered information on the alien attackers into a data codex and hid it in a bore shaft, some 3,000 metres below the planet's surface, hoping that it would be recovered later by the Imperium. Analyzing the recovered information. Inquisitor Kryptman is warrning us that this xenos are very dangerous and we need the whole fleet of the segmentum to defeat them. We name this xenos Tyranids after planet name Tyran. The first victim to great devour. Honouring an ancient tradition of naming invading alien forces by giving them an appellation drawn from the great beasts of ancient Terran myth, this first Tyranid Hive Fleet was designated as Behemoth."
tyrbeh1.4.desc:0 "Coming from the Eastern Fringes of the galaxy, Hive Fleet Behemoth is invading the Imperium of Man's Ultima Segmentum. It is likely that the Tyranid Hive Mind was drawn to the Milky Way Galaxy by either the beacon of the Astronomican in the Warp or the potent psychic presence of the Emperor Himself. Thankfully, the Ultramarines Space Marine Chapter is staying in its way."
tyrbeh1.5.desc:0 "The Ultramarines are quick to react, and the newly appointed Chapter Master, Marneus Calgar, is deploying the Ultramarine fleet to stop the Tyranid Hive Fleet at the garden world of Prandium -- the jewel of Ultramar, with gardens and forests of such amazing beauty and genetic craftsmanship that it is considered one of the Wonders of the Imperium -- a world that the Ultramarines were duty-bound to protect."
tyrbeh1.6.desc:0 "It was a slaughter. The tactics and strategies decreed by the Codex Astartes, a tome of knowledge created by the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman to govern all aspects of Imperial warfare, did not succeed against the Tyranids. The Ultramarine fleet had to sacrifice Prandium to consumption by the Hive Fleet. "
tyrbeh1.7.desc:0 "For a week, Marneus Calgar went without food or water while meditating on the matter. When he came out of his trance-like state, he told the Ultramarines that they had been guilty of the sin of pride. The Codex Astartes was written for the Space Marines, the Space Marines were not created for the Codex Astartes. They would have to adapt and develop new strategies and tactics, even weapons, if they were to be successful against the Tyranid menace. Hit and run raids were abandoned in place of concentrated defenses and static firepower. This meant that the Ultramarines had to choose a place to defend, and they chose their fortress-monastery on their homeworld of Macragge, the very heart of Ultramar."
tyrbeh1.8.desc:0 "The fighting is intense. Every Battle-Brother of the Chapter is deployed to defend the planet. Millions of Mycetic Spores were destroyed by the planetary defences, yet millions more got through and reached the surface of the world. Around the frozen northern laser defense batteries, Tyranid bodies stacked 10 deep. So corpse-covered was the ground, in fact, that one walked on them, and not on the frozen soil. The entire veteran Ultramarine First Company was wiped out - an enormous loss that the Chapter could ill-afford."
tyrbeh1.9.desc:0 "We won! The tyranids have been defeted! Many space marines and guardsmen have died to defend Imperium against this treat but it's and end..."

tyrbeh1.20.desc:0 "Fall of Maccrage! The planet have been completly destroyed! No one was able to escape... Is it the end to the Imperium?"
tyrbeh1.21.desc:0 "Roboute Guilliman, sometimes referred to as the Avenging Son, The Victorious, The Master of Ultrama" and The Blade of Unity was... slain during siege of Maccrage by the tyranids... It's a great lose to Imperium. Many planets have stop working to celebrate the memory of the dead and many more doubt the high lord of terra ability to govern... "

Recognizing the importance of such a valuable STC to the Imperium as well as an opportunity to capture an Adeptus Mechanicus High Fabricator that was overseeing the excavation, Malys decided to make this system her target. A conventional assault upon the world of Areadnnil was out of the question. The world was heavily fortified by not only the Imperial Guard and Skitarii Regiments, but also a Titan Legion of the Collegia Titanica and imposing orbital defenses.  Malys managed to circumvent the orbital defenses by assaulting a large fleet of nearby Orks then making a hasty withdrawal to Areadnnil. Taking the bait, the pursuing Orks slammed right into Areadnnil and created a chaotic distraction."

Krieg is devoured by a civil war which erupted suddenly and violently, between the heretical rebels who are supporting the High Autocrat and those citizens of Krieg who remained firm Imperial Loyalists. If we don't act fast, the rebels will overcome our loyalist forces and Krieg will be lost. We can launch Nuclear Weaponry that will kill Millions of enemy soldiers and billions of civilians, but it's a low price for defeating heretics."

With the veteran colonel at its helm, Ferrograd rapidly became the rallying point for the remaining Loyalist factions. But the situation for the Loyalists was dire; the rebel forces numbered in the millions and Ferrograd was soon cut off and besieged. The Loyalists were on their own; the planetary defences were under the Traitors' control, and those defences were strong enough that a full-scale fleet action would be required to breach them."

####### Imperium Secundus / plague of unbelief
imsecpu.1.desc:0 "Cardinal Bucharis controlled a small diocese of the Ecclesiarchy to the galactic southwest of Terra on a Cardinal World called Gathalamor. It was not a rich planet, and much of the population lived in poverty, but Bucharis was jealous and outraged by his peers' achievements. Bucharis vowed to build one of the biggest temples to the Emperor's glory in the galaxy. To achieve this, he enslaved the population of Gathalamor, treating them brutally, as if they were all slaves to jump at his command. Still Bucharis needed more resources and men to meet the ever growing need for his ambitious plans. In a radical move, he used a large group of thugs and cut-throats to conquer the nearby world of Rhanda. The planet had many rich mines producing all of the vital materials Bucharis needed to complete his designs."
imsecpu.2.desc:0 "Rebbelion on our planet! It's supported by Cardinal Bucharis."
imsecpu.3.desc:0 "Huge rebbelion on our planet! It's supported by Cardinal Bucharis."
imsecpu.4.desc:0 "The personal wealth of Bucharis grew from the profits made from the sale of precious ores and resources across his sector of the Imperium. Two other major players in the Plague of Unbelief were Admiral Sehalla, a flag officer of the Imperial Navy, and Colonel Gasto of the Rigellian XXVth Imperial Guard Regiment. Bucharis met with both of them on Rhanda and they joined forces under the Cardinal's command. Now, Bucharis had both naval support and real soldiers to fight for him, and he used them to carve out a small empire to the galactic west of Terra. He conquered fifty planets in seven years, using their resources to reinforce his army and continue his building plans."
imsecpu.5.desc:0 "Bucharis had consolidated his power over every planet he conquered and so he moved on. Three more Imperial Guard Regiments joined him, and when he moved on Hydraphur, the Segmentum Pacificus Fleet bowed down, believing Bucharis' words. Bucharis' forces were now massed, and able to strike at the heart of the Imperium, using surprise and cunning to overwhelm the enemy before they brought their superior numbers to bear."
imsecpu.6.desc:0 "Even though Bucharis' empire was growing, he was hesitant of getting too close to Terra. Therefore, he forged a path directly to the galactic north, leaving a bloody trail of death and destruction in his wake. In the south, he stopped just short of the world of Bakka, fearful that Admiral Sehalla's fleet would draw more attention to the young empire. Far to the north, he gave Cadia and the Eye of Terror a wide berth, fearful of drawing the attention of the forces of Chaos."
imsecpu.7.desc:0 "Eventually, as the armies of Bucharis moved north, they reached into the territories protected by the Space Wolves. As almost every Space Marine Chapter does, the Space Wolves protected a small number of planets within close proximity of Fenris, their homeworld. As Bucharis' massive fleet dropped out of the Warp, it encountered a Space Wolves strike cruiser called the Claw of Russ. After a brief battle, the cruiser escaped into the Warp, although not before it destroyed a rebel Navy cruiser and transport ship. Bucharis passed this off as a chance encounter, but this arrogance will cost him."
imsecpu.8.desc:0 "He ordered his starships to continue, taking planet after planet, until they jumped into the fifth star system. Here they met a surprise. This system contained the world of Fenris itself, the home of the Space Wolves, and as soon as the rebel Navy forces powered down their Warp drives, the Space Wolves' fleet attacked. The Space Wolves were outnumbered and out-gunned, but even this didn't stop them. They tore a hole in the rebel Navy fleet before retreating to lick their wounds and begin a hit and run attack campaign. They managed to keep about two-thirds of Bucharis' fleet occupied, but his forces still managed to make a landing on Fenris. Hundreds of transport ships descended into the thick, stormy atmosphere of Fenris and several were destroyed by the storms alone, and more by the defensive laser batteries from the ground. Despite this, a landing base was established and thousands of rebel Guardsmen swarmed out onto the ice of the northern regions of the planet. Despite the poor conditions, the troops of Bucharis were enraged at the loss of so many of their compatriots and vowed to destroy the Space Wolves. Any Fenrisian captured was put to work supplying the Guardsmen and laying out makeshift roads across the glacial flats. Though they were enslaved, the Fenrisians were not to be kept down easily. Several regiments of Imperial Guardsmen were kept out of the fighting to keep the Fenrisian slaves from revolting. Bucharis had conquered most of the planet before he approached the vast polar fortress that served as the Space Wolves' fortress-monastery and was called the Fang."
imsecpu.9.desc:0 "The rebels surrounded it and waited for more forces to be shuttled down from orbit. The Space Wolves' fleet maintained its hit-and-run tactics, destroying rebel transport ships before they managed to reach orbit. Despite this, the hills were swarming with rebel Guardsmen. Gigantic cannons bombarded the Fang and orbital ships rained fire from above. The mountains shook, creating avalanches and much destruction. Still, the defenses of the Fang remained intact."
imsecpu.10.desc:0 "Disaster! Hydraphur have betrayed us! It's a Forge World located in the Segmentum Pacificus and the location for the main Imperial Navy battlefleet headquarters in the whole Segmentum. Hydraphur is a prime recruiting ground for the Imperial Navy, with many of the prominent families on Hydraphur being connected to the Imperial Navy and various Rogue Trader houses. As a result of the influence of the Rogue Traders, Hydraphur is a commercial and manufacturing hub for the Imperium of Mankind. "

###### age of apostasy rebels
ageofapreb.1.desc:0 "Yet again, the demands for palaces and statues grew, forcing further increases in tithes. The people, already disgruntled, saw this increase as exorbitant and the population of many worlds across the Imperium rebelled against the rule of the Ecclesiarchy and refused to pay any tithes. Even Planetary Governors spoke out against the tithes and redirected the funds to their own purposes, although their pleas went unheard."
ageofapreb.2.desc:0 "Chaos raiders poured from the Eye of Terror, Ork Warlords rampaged across the galaxy and nobody could halt them. On the isolated worlds, Chaos and Genestealer Cults grew up, overthrowing the governments. Those worlds not overrun struggled to survive and eventually even the greatest of the planets collapsed. Even worship of the Emperor collapsed without direct leadership, most people splitting into cults that worshipped the Emperor in their own way and tried to force their ideas on the other cults forcefully."
ageofapreb.3.desc:0 "Crazed zealots across the galaxy denounced the Ecclesiarchy and preached that the Emperor was displeased with their greed and excesses, sending the warp storms as a test of the most faithful. Citizens turned to flagellation and self-mutilation to prove their love of the Emperor. The cults grew and fought and settled into seething masses of discontent, while some preached extreme measures, creating bloodthirsty pogroms to eradicate many innocents. Sometimes, whole populations were slaughtered for the heresy of just one person."
ageofapreb.4.desc:0 "Even while the Imperium was collapsing under the weight of rebellion, further dangers befell humanity. In early M36, warp storm instances increased and warp travel became impossible between most planets. With the resources of the Administratum and Ecclesiarchy centred on the power struggle, massive areas fell to anarchy as they were cut off. Those planets which could still be reached by starship were patrolled and controlled by the Ecclesiarchy with an iron fist. Burnings and executions became commonplace of all but the most faithful."
ageofapreb.5.desc:0 "Goge Vandire is the 361st High Lord of the Administratum and he have a reputation as a staunch resistor to the dominance of the Ecclesiarchy. It is said he used assassins to gain his position, but any who spoke out against him mysteriously disappeared or were found dead, so none dared oppose him. Shortly before his rise, Vandire was instrumental in the rise of Ecclesiarch Paulis III, an incompetent who was easily controlled by Vandire and his followers. Once he had taken full control of the Administratum, he used his powers to undermine the Ecclesiarchy, while he led a group of Imperial Guard officers into the Ecclesiarchal Palace and overthrew Paulis III in what can only be described as a military coup. He declared Paulis a heretic and had him shot. He then moved in and took control of the Ecclesiarchy, effectively controlling both at once as High Lord of the Administratum and Ecclesiarch."
ageofapreb.6.desc:0 "The Ecclesiarchy could do nothing to stop Vandire, shaken and battered as they were. Vandire purged the Ecclesiarchy of any who opposed him. Those Cardinals who had not already fled gathered onto a single ship and set off for Ophelia VII in an attempt to escape Vandire. Their ship was, however, engulfed by a gigantic warp storm and never seen again just as they entered the warp. Vandire used this as evidence to claim that it was the Emperor's will that they should die and that he himself should lead the faith of the Imperium. Vandire then elected Cardinals of his own choosing to fill the benches, including many weak-minded fools and several brilliant geniuses who were just cruel enough to follow Vandire. He now had total control of the two most powerful facets of the Imperium."
ageofapreb.7.desc:0 "As time went by, it became increasingly clear that Vandire was insane. He was a paranoid megalomaniac who saw traitors and conspiracy everywhere. His mind was twisted in every way and he enjoyed personally torturing people, declaring to onlookers that he was purging their souls for the Emperor. There were those under his command who would obey his every whim, including bombarding the Hive World of Calana VII without reason. He also ordered them to invade the farmlands of Boras Minor and enslave every female child under twelve years of age and melt the ice caps of Jhanna with the orbital defence cannons, drowning nearly four million people. All of his orders were meticulously recorded for posterity, including the deaths of millions. He would dictate long speeches bemoaning the state of the Imperium and demanding justice."
ageofapreb.8.desc:0 "It was now that a young agent arrived, with fear, on Terra, bringing a report from the distant world of Dimmamar. His report was merely disturbing, but Vandire burst into an apocalyptic rage. Dimmamar had denounced Vandire as a traitor to humanity, and one name was to be heard many times across the Segmentum Obscurus: Sebastian Thor. No one knew where this man had come from but the High Lords raged in debate for over a month on what should be done. Vandire fell more into himself and was seen huddled on the velvet throne in the meeting chamber, flanked by his Bride bodyguards. Within three months, eighty planets had fallen to the new Confederation of Light and only the power of the Frateris Templars held other populations in check. The most trusted of the Templar Frateris were dispatched to raze Dimmamar to the ground. Soon after the war fleet jumped into the warp from the base on Clax, it was destroyed by a gigantic Warp Storm. The last astropath reported white arcs of light tearing the ships apart, literally, as well as the soldiers on board. The Clax system has been cut off since, by the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath. With the death of a vast fleet, the whole of Segmentum Obscurus burst into rebellion. The Cardinal Palaces were stormed and the beautiful hangings were destroyed. No one knew who Thor was, and many suspected him to be a daemonic entity, but he was just a man, born in a Dimmamar Schola Progenium habitat. Thor claimed also to have had visions from the Emperor and warned that humanity was falling. He had an eloquence and charisma that none could match or understand and could reach into the hearts and minds of the people."


sebtor.1.desc: "Quickly, thousands travelled to hear Thor speak and preach and went away again, spreading the message themselves. Governor Gaius Welkonnen of Dimmamar was so impressed that he placed the army of Dimmamar at Thor's command. Anarchy followed. Most of the Segmentum Obscurus fell and many of Vandire's spies were sought out and driven away, although he still knew that Thor's army had grown to at least five million. He also knew it was slowly making its way to Terra. There were many tales of his trip to Terra. Each planet he passed pledged their loyalty to him, mostly through his oratory skills. Though the rest of the galaxy was still covered by warp storms, Thor's ships had no hindrance as they moved from planet to planet. The Paternova of the Navigators dubbed him Abstracta Preomnis, Master of the Warp. Soon, in the far reaches of the galaxy, Thor was being hailed as a god-like figure. The Ecclesiarchy could do little to stop him after the destruction of the Frateris Templar, but the Cardinals and Confessors put up a resistance, though their populations were eventually converted to the Confederation of Light. Now, the masses moved against Vandire, as he had pushed them too far, and this time, they had a leader to unite behind."

calicoata.1.desc:0 " Golgenna Angevin, a powerful noble from the Terran Court, is raised to the rank of Lord Militant in the Imperial Guard and granted a writ from the High Lords of Terra to persecute an Imperial Crusade to liberate and dominate the area of space designated as the Calyx Expanse. His Crusade's forces are drawn principally from the Segmentum Solar and number over 17 million levied troops who are divided into 4 battle groups. With the first and second great phases of its vast operation complete, (and partly owing to battle fatigue after 30 standard years of Crusade), Lord Militant Angevin’s forces consolidated their hold of what was more than 200 captured worlds. With the Angevin Crusade’s forward impetus stalled, its domains begin to come under repeated and sustained attack from the storms of an Ork WAAAGH!, and the privations of xenos corsairs and raiders whose assaults claim the lives of millions.
